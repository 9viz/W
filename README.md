# W

W (pronounced "double vee") is a WIP epic language project focused on speed, consistency and safety.

# What Features?

All the good ones (WIP).

This includes (but is not limited to):

1. High speed through smart optimizations
2. Super consistent language
3. Epic meta programming
4. Enjoyable for Lisp and Forth lovers alike
5. Super safe language (thread safety, type safety, etc.)
6. Integrated dependency management
7. Glorious Emoji Support!!!!

# The Source

You probably noticed that there is no source yet.
That is on purpose!
W is yet to be written and polished.
We want this to be as epic as possible, so we spend a lot of time on polishing the details.
Actually implementing it is only a small step afterwards.

# Examples

I'm 100% sure there will be many examples (WIP) soon, that will display epic stuff done in an epic way.
Hire me (niclas@countingsort.com) btw.

# Contributing

If you have any questions or feel like something is unclear feel free to open an issue.
Pull requests with additional examples are welcome (and will be reviewed/fixed up), so you can actually play around with W before it's done!
