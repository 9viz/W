# W

W (pronounced "double vee") is a WIP language focused on speed, consistency and safety. 
A variety of features including integrated dependency management have been
planned. See the next section to know some more planned features.

# What Features?

The current planned features include:

- High speed achieved through smart optimizations
- Consistency throughout the language
- Meta programming
- Safety (read thread safety, type safety, etc.)
- Integrated dependency handling
- Emoji support

# The Source

We want W to be one of the best languages out there so we spend a lot of
time on polishing the details and planning out the implementation. Implementation is a lot
simpler than the current stage (planning/polishing stage).

# Examples

As mentioned before, W is still a WIP so there are no examples yet. There will be more examples in
the future. Make sure to stay tuned!

# Contributing

If you have any questions or feel like something is unclear feel free to open an issue.
Pull requests with additional examples are welcome (and will be reviewed/fixed up), so you can actually play around with W before it's done!
